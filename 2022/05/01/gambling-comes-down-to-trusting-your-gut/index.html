<p>Lies. Deceit. Mistrust.</p>
<p>All of these were things we faced in our NBA Playoffs Gambling Assignment for this semester of Advanced Sports Data and Analysis. Had we been more aware of these things, our group would’ve placed first in the class. Unfortunately, we were naive and placed trust where it didn’t belong, and we got burned for it. We somehow finished in third after successfully going all-in on the second-to-last night of bets. Pain.</p>
<p>So how did we get here? We first created a model that would predict winners of NBA Playoff games. We used a sports vector machine as our algorithm, and our predictors were point differential, net ratings, rolling true shooting percentage, adjusted margin of victory, and rolling bleals (a rolling metric combining blocks and steals). Our thought process was that throughout the regular season, the best teams should not just defeat their opponent, they should destroy their opponent. We thought this would be a great indicator of who the best teams were in the playoffs which is why we added both point differential and adjusted margin of victory (a metric that balances a team’s margin of victory with the strength of their opponent) into our model. We also thought that in the NBA, offense wins games. I mean look around the league, hardly anybody plays defense. We included a rolling true shooting metric to reflect this, as well as blocks and steals because these lead to more offensive possessions.</p>
<p>Once we had our model, we began predicting games and making bets in our dry-run. We actually performed fairly well in our dry-run and followed our model pretty consistently. Once the dry-run was over and our actual betting began, shit began to hit the fan fairly quickly. We were not replicating our success from the dry-run the way we had hoped, so we began to put more human input into our betting decisions rather than just trusting our model blindly. We took several things into account when making bets, such as game location, starting lineups, injuries, where the game was at in the series, and finally our model predictions. Once we had our model predictions, our group collaborated via slack and collectively decided what games to bet on, what teams to bet, and how much we were going to bet.</p>
<p>Overall, I think our group fared pretty well. We went 12-7 on bets. We hit on a few key games, but also missed on couple that hurt us pretty bad. For example, we had $550 on the Suns in a game we really needed them to win, and we got burned. That wasn’t the only time the Suns burned us either. As someone who grew up just outside of Phoenix, some of the losses we sustained on their behalf seemed personal. I felt like I was letting my team down at times, until we decided to make our big move on the second-to-last day of betting. We were in fourth place, but we all had a feeling the Devin Booker was going to come back for Game 6 against the Pelicans and that he was going to go on a tear. The moneyline was favorable because he was still listed as “out” at the time we made the bet, but we trusted our gut and went all in on the Suns, and it hit. Suddenly we jumped into first place by a decent margin and were sitting pretty as we went into the last day of betting. We were back in the positive and were riding the high of previous bet. There was one game left to bet on, and we all had the feeling that other teams were going to try and replicate our success and dethrone us. We were contemplating risking a hefty sum again, but were scared to lose all the money that we had just made. We were on the fence about whether to bet heavy and assure victory if we won or play it easy and hope no other teams got lucky on the final night of betting. We finally decided to play it easy, only after we heard from the group in second place that they were planning to take it easy as well and enjoy their successful finish. We were bamboozled. If we had went all-in again and trusted our gut, we would’ve still finished in first place. Alas, we decided to play it safe and were rewarded with a third place finish. It just stings. We went from a group in second-to-last place to first place and back down to the middle of the pack in just over 24 hours. We had first place in our grasp but we let it slide through our finger tips.</p>
<p>Overall in this assignment, the biggest thing I’m taking away is to trust your gut. I had a gut feeling about many games we bet the other way on and it seemed like we lost almost all of those games. We had a gut feeling on the Suns in Game 6 and trusting our gut paid out heavily. We had a gut feeling to try our luck again in back-to-back nights but went against it and it hurt us bad. Models can only do some much. They can only predict winners based on set predictors, and even then it can never predict with 100% accuracy. Models can be a great tool to get a more statistical outlook on things, but you can’t trust them blindly. If these sports models could predict with 100% accuracy, everyone would be a millionaire. You have to put some weight on what your model predicts in your final decision, but the majority of the weight should be placed on your gut.</p>
