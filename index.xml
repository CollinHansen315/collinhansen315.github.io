      <description>Ndamukong Suh was, and still is, a force to be reckoned with on the football field. He was one of the most dominant college players to ever play his position, and has carried that legacy with him into the NFL. Opposing teams feared him during his time at Nebraska. Opposing offensive lineman were petrified heading into their games against Nebraska, scrambling their minds trying to figure out any way to stop Suh.</description>

      <description>Nebraska football has arguably the most loyal fans in all of college athletics. The sense of pride in their football program is no different. Fans of Nebraska will support the team until the day they die, but many have begun to lose hope in Scott Frost returning the team to glory. Scott Frost is the hometown hero that came back to Nebraska and won a national championship, and heâ€™s the one that came back to Nebraska yet again to try and help them win even more as a coach.</description>

      <description>My name is Collin Hansen and I am a Sports Media &amp;amp; Communications Major at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. I am originally from Omaha, Nebraska but spent 17 years of my life growing up in Chandler, Arizona. I came back to Nebraska to go to college because I wanted to further my education and dive into a potential future in the world of sports media and sports data analytics. This website showcases my sports data analytics that I have completed during my time as a student at the University of Nebraska.</description>
