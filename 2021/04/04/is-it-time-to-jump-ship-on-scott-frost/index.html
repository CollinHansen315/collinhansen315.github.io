<p>Nebraska football has arguably the most loyal fans in all of college athletics. The sense of pride in their football program is no different. Fans of Nebraska will support the team until the day they die, but many have begun to lose hope in Scott Frost returning the team to glory. Scott Frost is the hometown hero that came back to Nebraska and won a national championship, and he’s the one that came back to Nebraska yet again to try and help them win even more as a coach. This is the most ideal situation a Husker fan could imagine, but it hasn’t worked out thus far. Frost is entering his fourth year of being the head football coach at Nebraska, and the most loyal and patient fan base in America is getting unruly. Are the many who have lost hope justified in giving up on the hometown hero so early? Is he really as bad as some of the previous coaches (Mike Riley)?</p>

<p>For this, I am only looking at coaches Devaney-era and later since it was a different style of game back then and this is when Nebraska really started being dominant, so let’s filter out any data before 1962 when Devaney took over. Our data has the coaches name and record for every year under the “Coach(es)” column, so let’s go ahead and separate that out into Coach and Record as well.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>separate &lt;- fbdata %&gt;%
  filter(Year &gt; 1961) %&gt;% 
  mutate(`Coach(es)`=gsub(&quot; &quot;,&quot;&quot;,`Coach(es)`)) %&gt;% 
  separate(`Coach(es)`, into=c(&quot;Coach&quot;, &quot;Record&quot;), sep=&quot;\\(&quot;) %&gt;% 
  mutate(Record=gsub(&quot;).*&quot;,&quot;&quot;, Record))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: Expected 2 pieces. Additional pieces discarded in 2 rows [7, 18].</code></pre>
<p>Let’s look at the average strength of schedule for all coaches since Devaney, and compare it to their average simple rating system score (according to sports-reference.com, simple rating system is, “A rating that takes into account average point differential and strength of schedule. The rating is denominated in points above/below average, where zero is the average”.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SOSandSRS &lt;- separate %&gt;% 
  select(Coach,SRS, SOS) %&gt;% 
  group_by(Coach) %&gt;% 
  summarise(AverageSRS = mean(SRS),
            AverageSOS = mean(SOS)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(desc(AverageSRS))</code></pre>
<p>Finally, let’s make our scatter plot. I have highlighted Osborne and Devaney as the two best coaches in Nebraska history as well as Riley and Frost in order to look at two of the worst.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ScottFrost &lt;- SOSandSRS %&gt;%

As we can see from the scatter plot above, Frost isn’t doing too hot. While he has had a decent strength of schedule rating, he has the worst simple rating system score of any Nebraska football coach in the last 60 years. Yikes. His rating is even worse than Mike Riley, who the Nebraska football fan base had low expectations for and were still left disappointed.</p>
<p>Maybe this isn’t that bad? I mean it does look pretty bad, but let’s try to look at the bright side. Frost has only completed three seasons at Nebraska, the last of which was a shortened season due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Osborne couldn’t have been that good right out of the gate could he?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at all of these coaches’ first five years at the helm of Nebraska football. I am going to look at their win percentage over their first five seasons(If they made it that far), and I feel that five seasons is enough time to get your recruits in, get your system in place, and start seeing some results.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>First5yearsofcoaching &lt;- separate %&gt;% 
  filter(`Years Coaching Nebraska` &lt;=5)</code></pre>
<p>I have included the average win percentage since Devaney took over for reference in the form of the horizontal blue line in each graph.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look the graphs of all coaches first five seasons at Nebraska.</p>

    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),

    plot.caption = element_text(size=6),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2021/04/04/is-it-time-to-jump-ship-on-scott-frost/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="672" />
Yet again, yikes. Devaney never dipped below the average, and Osborne maintained a pretty solid winning percentage over the 25 years that he coached at Nebraska. Frost on the other hand is nowhere close to even being at the average win percentage. Riley didn’t do too hot either, but at least he showed some sort of promise in his second season. Frost has not given Nebraska fans any sort of promise thus far.</p>
<p>Alright, alright, we get it. Scott Frost has over-promised and under-delivered thus far. But there’s got to be some metric that Frost is performing well in. Let’s look at one of the most important things for a college football program to maintain their dominance, bowl appearances.</p>
<p>To do this, we are first going to take our bowl data and filter out all coaches pre-Devaney in order to highlight it in our plot later on. Also, let’s take out Barney Cotton since he only coached one game for Nebraska.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>topcoaches&lt;- bowlsdata %&gt;% 
  filter(From &gt;= 1962) %&gt;% 
  filter(Coach != &quot;Barney Cotton&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now let’s make our plots. I am going to make a bubble chart that shows all the coaches in Nebraska history’s winning percentage and bowl appearances. The size of the bubbles will be their winning percentage and their position on the chart will be the number of appearances compared to the number of years that coach was at Nebraska.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    data=bowlsdata, 
    aes(x=Yrs, y=`Bowl Games`, size=`Overall Pct`), 
    color=&quot;light grey&quot;, 
    alpha=.5) + 
  scale_size(range = c(-10, 17), name=&quot;Overall Win Percentage&quot;) +
  geom_point(
    data=topcoaches, 
    aes(x=Yrs, y=`Bowl Games`, size=`Overall Pct`), 
    color=&quot;Red&quot;, 
    alpha = .6) +
  theme_minimal()+labs(title=&quot;Nebraska Coaches&#39; Bowl Appearances and Winning Percentage Over Their Careers&quot;, subtitle=&quot;Scott Frost is the only coach since devaney that hasn&#39;t won a bowl game,and he has the lowest winning percentage of these coaches &quot;, x=&quot;Years Coaching at Nebraska&quot;, y=&quot;Bowl Game Appearances&quot;, caption=&quot;Source: sports-reference.com | Chart by Collin Hansen&quot;) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(size = 11, face = &quot;bold&quot;),
    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=7),
    plot.caption = element_text(size= 6),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2021/04/04/is-it-time-to-jump-ship-on-scott-frost/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="672" />
See that smallest red dot at the very bottom? That’s Scott Frost. In his three years at Nebraska, he has yet to even make it to a bowl game. Even Mike Riley made it to a bowl game in his three years at Nebraska.</p>
<p>Scott Frost will have more leniency and patience than probably anybody else in his position due to his legacy at Nebraska, but even the most loyal of Nebraska fans are starting to lose hope. Nobody expects him to be competing for national championships this soon, but any sort of promise at this point would be nice.</p>
<p>In short, is it justified for Nebraska fans to start jumping ship on Scott Frost as a head coach? Yes. He will always hold a special place in the hearts of Nebraska fans for what he did as a player, but if he wants to keep his coaching job, he better start getting things moving in the right direction, and fast.</p>
